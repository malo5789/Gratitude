# Gratitude
I'm trying to make my own compiler coding language. I'm calling it Gratitude after my laid stepfather. He always pushed coding on me and this project I think is a way, my way to find Gratitude in my life.
Here are some languages I'm familiar with.
Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQL, and Jquery.
I have certificates in each of these "Languages" on W3schools.
Trying to "Catch them all", but i haven't.
Anyway I'm the lead on this project so I better start acting on it. Also I'm getting my degree in Catholic Studies w/ a minor in English at the University of St. Thomas.
